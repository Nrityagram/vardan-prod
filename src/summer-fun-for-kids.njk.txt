			Far from the bustle of Bangalore, the Nrityagram Dance Village houses a group of dancers who have excelled in pursuit of their art. They have performed across the world, won numerous awards and earned global acclaim. According to The New York Times “The only proper response to dancers this amazing is worship!”
		</p>
    <p>Who are these dancers, and what do they do all day at Nrityagram?</p>
    <p>
      Every year, a small group of children get an opportunity to enrol in Nrityagram’s Summer Fun for Kids to find out for themselves, by leading the Nrityagram life focused on dance and theatre. They explore spaces, go on nature walks, tell stories, play games and most importantly have lots of fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nrityagram’s Summer Fun for Kids is a unique short-term residential camp, which brings to participants a compact experience of the Nrityagram philosophy of learning as a way of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away from television sets and video games, surrounded by lush foliage, beautiful birds and flowering trees, they experience life in a place where all residents take care of themselves and their “home" and where the entire community lives mindfully. The camp also gives children a glimpse into the guru-shishya parampara followed at Nrityagram, while they are led through dance and theatre sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp participants follow a five-hour daily learning schedule, with theatre and dance in two separate batches, in addition to engaging in and learning simple day-to-day activities such as cleaning, cooking and gardening. They also participate in yoga and body conditioning classes, in addition to fun sessions in art. Most of the children (and their parents) describe the experience as ‘life changing’.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two basic components of the camp are dance and theatre. One of India’s best known Odissi Dancers <a href="/pavithra" class="bodylink">Pavithra Reddy</a>, a <a href="/ensemble" class="bodylink">Nrityagram Ensemble</a> and faculty member, will lead the sessions in Odissi dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year we have invited Shruti Jasani to teach theatre and Yoga classes. Shruti leads the faculty at The Wooden Stage, a performance arts institute in Mumbai teaching aerial art to over 400 students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone will live at the Nrityagram campus.

			Nrityagram’s Outreach Programme on Sundays, started in 1990 by founder <a href="/protima" class="bodylink">Protima Gauri</a>, is a part of Project Nrityagyān (Dance Education) with a broadened vision to also promote personal growth by developing a strong sense of discipline, high standards of excellence and self-esteem, thus providing children tools to a successful future. 
		</p>
    <p>
			Nrityagram’s dancers have developed a method of teaching that is educational, exciting, fun and at the same time uncompromising on excellence and the high standards required to learn classical dance. Our classes are full of energy, passion, commitment, honesty and respect from both sides - teacher and students. This method has helped us to almost instantly win a child's trust because they immediately feel SAFE in class. Children receive honest feedback while knowing that each of them is special, that there are small achievements every day and that they will succeed. And they enthusiastically accept feedback and wholeheartedly put their efforts into new challenges. 
		</p>
    <p>
      Our summer camp aspires to heighten this experience for participants by being residential and intensive, as well as multidisciplinary. The simple goals that are the prime focus of this camp are building self-confidence, fostering team spirit, self and group motivation, kindling creative imagination, physical coordination, awareness of rhythms and a sense of music, and nurturing uninhibited expression.
