                        We conduct free lecture-demonstrations in schools, universities, and local villages to build knowledge about the classical arts. Over three decades, more than 500,000 children and adults have benefitted from our Project Nrityagyān endeavours. Your Annual donation will enable us to continue this valuable work.

          <p>
                        Nrityagram aims to be a place that nurtures artistic growth and exchange. We provide an artistic haven for creative professionals ranging from dancers to writers to theatre practitioners, and offer subsidies of 50% - 100% on Lodge and Board. Your Annual donation will make it possible to help a community that typically lacks support.
