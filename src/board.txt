            Nirupama Menon Rao was all of 12 when she decided that her life’s mission was to join the Indian Foreign
            Service and become a diplomat. That early clarity of vision blossomed into a spectacular career that saw her
            serve as India’s Foreign Secretary from 2009-2011 and India’s Ambassador to the United States, China, and Sri
            Lanka. Throughout her journey, negotiating corridors of power, she has been a strong advocate of dialogue and
            communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her quest to seek harmony between countries and people continued after she retired from active service, and
            led her to rediscover her other love, music. In 2017, she released an album, ‘Peace is my dream’.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has penned a book of poetry ‘Rain Rising’ that has been translated into different languages, including
            Malayalam, Chinese and Russian. She is currently working on a book, ‘Tell it to the Mountain, India and China,
            1949-1962’.
          </p>
          <p>
            With her husband Sudhakar Rao, who retired as the Chief Secretary of Karnataka, she is a Founder-Trustee of
            the South Asian Symphony Foundation, Bangalore. The Foundation is dedicated to the use of music as a medium to
            promote peace and understanding in South Asia and building a South Asian Symphony Orchestra.

          <p>
            Since she took over as the Managing Trustee of the Odissi Dance Centre Trust and Executive Director of
            Nrityagram School and Ensemble in 1997, Lynne has been at the helm of a journey in artistic and institutional
            excellence that continuously shatters benchmarks to forge them afresh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lynne guided the emergence of the Nrityagram Ensemble onto the international arena. Her projects include Kula,
            a residence where arts practitioners can live and create new work, and a Performing Arts Centre comprising a
            theatre, exhibition space and rehearsal studios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lynne began her career as a psychologist, working with severely disturbed young adults for several years. She
            worked as an actor and lighting designer with several notable theatre directors including Barry John, Joy
            Michael, Ranjit Kapoor and Lillete Dubey. During her work in theatre, she discovered her love for lights and
            continues to create magic, sculpting light for Nrityagram’s performances.

He has worked on strategy, sales implementation as well as brand and communications program development projects in the area of banking & financial services, non‐profit organizations, information technology companies and various medium and small enterprises.

            Sridhar Mahadevan seeks to understand the fundamental principles of the universe, be it in terms of underlying order or manifest expression. Fueled by his curiosity about how the universe works, he opted for a dual degree course that combined electrical engineering and a post-graduate program in physics at BITS Pilani. He went on to become a Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of iLink Systems, which is a multi-million dollar software services firm, headquartered in Redmond, WA, USA.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was introduced to dance by his mother, a Bharatanatyam practitioner. As an adult, he underwent formal training in Bharatanatyam and Kalaripayattu. He became an ardent rasika, attending as many dance concerts as he could, and voraciously read on theory and dance forms across the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            His abiding interest in movement, as both a student and rasika, led him to knock on the doors of Nrityagram. In 2009, he began volunteering with Nrityagram and assisting with social media outreach and logistics of performance. Committed to Nrityagram’s nurture and growth, he works with the organisation in different capacities.
          </p>
          <p>
            He continues to pursue independent research in physics and mathematics, focusing on infinity and foundations of logic.

          Sridhar Mahadevan seeks to understand the fundamental principles of the universe, be it in terms of underlying order or manifest expression. Fueled by his curiosity about how the universe works, he opted for a dual degree course that combined electrical engineering and a post-graduate program in physics at BITS Pilani. He went on to become a Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of iLink Systems, which is a multi-million dollar software services firm, headquartered in Redmond, WA, USA.

          He was introduced to dance by his mother, a Bharatanatyam practitioner. As an adult, he underwent formal training in Bharatanatyam and Kalaripayattu. He became an ardent rasika, attending as many dance concerts as he could, and voraciously read on theory and dance forms across the world.

          His abiding interest in movement, as both a student and rasika, led him to knock on the doors of Nrityagram. In 2009, he began volunteering with Nrityagram and assisting with social media outreach and logistics of performance. Committed to Nrityagram’s nurture and growth, he works with the organisation in different capacities.

          He continues to pursue independent research in physics and mathematics, focusing on infinity and foundations of logic.
