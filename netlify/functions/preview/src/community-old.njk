			Our Village Outreach was started in 1990 by founder <a href="/protima" class="bodylink">Protima Gauri</a>. Her
			focus was to bring classical dance training to rural kids in an effort to popularise the classical arts of India.
		</p>
    <p>
			In 1998, the Village Outreach became a part of our Project Nrityagyān (Dance Education) with a broadened vision to
			also promote personal growth by developing a strong sense of discipline, high basics of excellence and self
			esteem. Thus providing them tools to a successful future.
		</p>
    <p>
			Using a teaching method brought to us by Tracy Straus of the National Dance Institute, New York, our classes are
			full of energy, passion, commitment, honesty and respect on both sides - teacher and students. This helps us to
			almost instantly win each child's trust because they immediately feel safe in class. Children receive honest
			feedback knowing that each of them is special, that there are small achievements every day and that they will
			succeed. The children stay focused with amazingly high energy and concentration for three hours, regardless of
			their age. And that’s how they enthusiastically accept and wholeheartedly put their efforts into new challenges.
		</p>
    <p>The groups are organised as 4 to 12 years, above 12, fresh learners and advanced learners.</p>
    <p>
      <a href="/pavithra" class="bodylink">Pavithra Reddy</a>, who initially joined this programme and was selected for
			further training in 1993, is a stellar example of the success of our Village Outreach.

    </span>
    <p>
			Vasantahabba, Nrityagram’s annual spring festival, was envisioned to take India’s classical heritage back to its
			roots by bringing the greatest performers to rural Karnataka.
		</p>
    <p>
			Vasantahabba was an all-night festival that hosted great masters of Indian dance and music. People arrived at noon
			for an event that started at 6pm. They came with family; they came with friends. They came from all over India;
			they even came from abroad. City dwellers came; so did the villagers. They knew everything about Indian culture;
			they knew nothing about Indian culture. Whoever they were, they did not leave before dawn. It truly was the
			Woodstock of India.
		</p>
    <p>
			During the course of 15 Vasantahabba celebrations, over 200 performers have presented to more than 400,000 people
			live and thousands more around the world via live-streaming and telecast.

			“Once upon a time...” These are magic words, for they make a promise of a scintillating tale to come. We all become children when we hear these words, sitting around an elder with evening lamps casting flickering shadows that mirror all the fleeting emotions we experience – fear, worry, joy, and of course the fun of listening to stories.
		</p>
    <p>
      <em>Ajji Kathegalu</em>, is Nrityagram opening a portal for us to enter our childhood again, an invitation to listen to tales from here and there, and laugh and once again experience the wondrous possibilities stories spark within us.
		</p>
    <p>1st Sunday of the month, 12pm at Nrityagram.</p>
    <p>All are welcome.</p>

    <p>
      For three decades, Nrityagram’s natural surroundings, wholesome 
lifestyle and inspired practice, have generated and nourished artistic dialogue and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
			Stimulated by the unique ambience, artistes from various disciplines have expressed a desire to live and create work at Nrityagram. So, in order to support collaboration and 
allow access to the holistic energising space that we have created, we built Kula, a home for artistes. Kula (from Gurukula meaning 
Community / Clan / Tribe) is a space for artistes to meet, converse, and create – an interdisciplinary crucible for the arts. 
		</p>
    <p>
			Kula has grown organically to be a haven that nurtures the cross-pollination of artistic work and has become a centre for both innovation and experimentation, 
for artistes from diverse backgrounds. Given the paucity of such spaces, 
Kula is sought after by artistes who seek to create, unhindered by distractions of diurnal concerns, in a space nurtured by Nrityagram’s 
single-minded dedication to the arts.
		</p>
    <p>
			Since November 2010, Kula has hosted several hundred dancers, writers, theatre practitioners and musicians, as both independent artistes and groups. Located in the heart of a living artistic community dedicated to Excellence, residencies at Kula deliver a wonderful support system that allows artistes to thrive and be inspired.

			Dance is not just about movement, it is about uniting thought, breath, emotion, and body in a whole. In a world
			where artificial binaries of body and mind, emotion and reason, and thought and deed exist, dance provides the
			vocabulary and path to reconceive the relationship we have with ourselves, our communities, and the earth at
			large.
		</p>
    <p>
			Nrityagyān, our initiative to spread awareness about dance was started in the mid-nineties, and strives for as
			many people as possible to access the healing possibilities that dance offers.
		</p>
    <div>
      <P>Through Nrityagyān we:</P>
      <ul class="basic">
        <li>
				Conduct sensitisation and knowledge building programmes for people so that the audience base for the classical
				arts is expanded.
			</li>
        <li>
				Open the world of classical dance to the young through lecture-demonstrations in schools, universities, and
				community associations.
			</li>
        <li>Research the use of classical dance in education, therapy and rehabilitation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
			Over the last three decades, over 500,000 children and adults have benefitted from our Project Nrityagyān through
			a range of activities that include workshops and lecture-demonstrations.
		</p>
    <p>
			In the next phase of development, we plan to set-up a Resource Centre for scholars to document and research Indian
			classical dance, and to publish the work done at Nrityagram over the last three decades.

        In these troubled times, our spirit is exhausted and we seek solace. We want to rest under the shade of a quiet moment. To find comfort and strength in community and shared experiences.
		</p>
    <p>
			So, we created <a href="https://spatial.chat/s/nrityagram" class="bodylink" target="_blank">Quiet Space</a> where twice a day, we can gather together and listen to music - multi-faith
			devotional music, songs of hope, music to soothe our souls, perhaps even birdsong from Nrityagram - anything
			that will bring us peace and courage. A Circle of Solace for all of us.

          What do dancers dream of when no one is watching? What are their deepest desires, fears, and hopes for tomorrow? What do they aspire for? Can there be a community of Indian classical dancers that speaks to their aspirations and dreams, and works as a collective for the needs and aims of the dancers? In today's context, young Indian classical dancers face different kinds of pressures from having to perform on stages as well as on social media, lack of adequate financial support, anxieties over ever-increasing competition, and vying for scarce resources. The artistic journeys of young Indian classical dancers are often framed as that of an individual; lonely, anxious, and having to fend for themselves. In such a context, is the idea of a ‘community’ relevant for young dancers? If yes, what is their imagination of such a ‘community’? And crucially, are young dancers prepared to become more than solo artists on an individual journey, and find meaning and kinship in a collective?
        </p>
        <p>
          These were some of the questions raised by <a href="/surupa" class="bodylink">Surupa Sen</a>, Artistic Director of Nrityagram. Given Surupa's own lived experience of having been part of a community of dancers over three decades, and having experienced firsthand how the community has shaped her art, she wanted to understand what was in the minds of young dancers. After multiple conversations with different people, including students, patrons, and her peers, she initiated the idea of conducting a dialogue with young dancers. The premise was simple – let us ask young dancers what they think; do they see value in the idea of a community? And thus, the Dance Commons was born, a space for young dancers to come together and converse, share their stories, and imagine together what their collective futures could look like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toward this goal, a two-day dialogue was planned at Nrityagram and on 19th and 20th August 2023, the first Dance Commons brought together young dancers from all over India to reflect on questions about their art, passion, dreams, and the future, and to ideate and shape what a community for Indian classical dance could be. It was a space of fertile discomfort, from which a collective dream took shape.
