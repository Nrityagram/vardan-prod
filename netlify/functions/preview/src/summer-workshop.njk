      Our Summer Workshop is a unique residential programme in Odissi basics as developed and practised at Nrityagram, which also brings to students a compact experience of our philosophy of “practising art as a way of life”. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Odissi will be taught by <a href="/surupa" class="bodylink">Surupa Sen</a> (Artistic Director Nrityagram Dance Ensemble) and <a href="/pavithra" class="bodylink">Pavithra Reddy</a> (Director of Educational and Outreach Programmes), both of whom have been studying and practising at Nrityagram for the past 34 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoga sessions will be led by Jaya Chakraborty who has over 2 decades of training and teaching. In 2013 Jaya founded The Practice Room, Bangalore.

			Workshop participants engage in a rigorous daily schedule where they participate in <b>over 5 hours of class and practice</b>.  In addition to training, students are responsible for maintaining their personal environment by taking care of the Gurukula, cleaning their own living spaces, doing their laundry and cleaning up after each meal. 
		</p>
    <p>
			Even though the workshop offers basic training in Odissi, in true Nrityagram fashion students are also taught Yoga and physical conditioning techniques based on traditional exercises and the Natyashastra.  The study of dance-scriptures like the Abhinaya Darpana is an integral part of the experience, in addition to learning rhythmic exercises based on structures specific to Odissi dance.

			Nrityagram is located in a beautiful 10-acre campus, an hour outside Bangalore.  The campus includes everything that is needed for your stay, from residences to a dining hall to multiple dance studios where classes are held.  We are proud to offer an environment that is architecturally stunning and in complete harmony with the natural surroundings.  Though it is simple in many ways, it is truly a beautiful space that captivates all our students.

      Nrityagram is a working residential campus that is home to our principal dancers and teachers and also our resident students.  We have students who live and study with us anywhere from 1- 6 years, participating in extensive Odissi dance training.
