    <p>
			Our Summer Workshop is a unique programme, which brings to students a compact experience of our philosophy of
			“learning as a way of life”.
		</p>
    <p>
			Students engage in a rigorous daily schedule where they participate in 5 hours of supervised classes, and have
			time and studio space for independent rehearsal. Even though the workshop offers basic training in Odissi, in true Nrityagram fashion students are also taught <em>Yoga,</em>
      <em>Kalaripayattu,</em> and western physical conditioning techniques. The study of dance-scriptures like <em>Abhinaya Darpana</em> and <em>Natyashastra</em> is an integral part of the experience, in addition to learning complex rhythm structures. Students are also encouraged to create their own choreography based on the vocabulary they have learned at Nrityagram.

    <h2 class="center">Summer Fun for Kids</h2>
    <p>
			Our Summer Fun for Kids is a unique residential workshop designed to help young ones understand community
			living. Every year a small group of children enrol in this workshop to find out for themselves,
			what is the Nrityagram way of life. Far away from television sets and video games, surrounded by lush foliage,
			beautiful birds and flowering trees, they experience life in a place where all residents take care of themselves
			and their home, and the cornerstone for the entire community is mindful living and the pursuit of excellence. 
		</p>
    <p>
			The focus is dance but they also go for
			nature walks, tell stories, play games and most importantly, have lots of fun.
		</p>
    <p>	
			Most of the children (and their parents) describe the experience as “life changing”.

    <p>
			NG101 is crafted for our younger dancers who are ready to take this step of making a deeper commitment to dance
			and to start on the path of a life-changing relationship with Nrityagram. By engaging them in our everyday
			practice, the goal is to nurture a nuanced appreciation of Odissi and for these young dancers to grow into dance
			practitioners or attentive <em>rasikas</em>.

			In Bangalore, <a href="/surupa" class="bodylink">Surupa Sen</a> has a training programme for people with an
			interest in Odissi who may not have the option of becoming professional dancers or have successful careers or
			families of their own or all of the above.
		</p>
    <p>
			Classes are for 2 hours a day on Thursdays and Saturdays. There are 2 groups - under 12 and above 12, and there
			are several Mother-Daughter combinations in this programme.
		</p>
    <p>
			This is a specially satisfying programme for our teachers because of the noticeable change and growth in the students.

    <p>
			Every week, young students from the city who have a keen interest in Odissi, come for our Sunday Class. These students, aged between seven and fifteen undergo a specially crafted programme, which prepares them for advanced training, if that is what they choose to pursue.
		</p>
    <p>
			Many students from the Sunday Class have moved on to the advanced class, demonstrating the success of such a focused intervention.
