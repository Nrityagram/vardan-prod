				<h1>Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship</h1>
				<p>
					We are delighted that the family of Shri VK Laroia, has decided to establish the
					Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship at Nrityagram, to carry forward his legacy of patronage for the
					arts and artists.
				</p>
				<p>
					An engineer with a great love and passion for the arts, especially Indian classical music and dance,
					Shri VK Laroia could be found at most music and dance recitals presented in Delhi and was constantly
					and actively engaged in the promotion and patronage of Indian performing arts. Incidentally, Shri VK
					Laroia's father, Dr. Banarsi Das Laroia was the first Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University;
					Bangalore, the beloved home of Nrityagram.
				</p>
				<p>
					While establishing the Fellowship, the family of Shri VK Laroia said, “9th November 2020 would have
					been his 89th birthday, and there is no better gift we could think of giving him than a Fellowship
					in his name, for a deserving candidate in an art form he so admired.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship will ensure that a gifted young dancer is completely supported
					in their journey and that Nrityagram continues to inspire future generations of dancers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are tremendously grateful for this contribution, and we look forward to working with the Laroia
					family to make the best use of this opportunity, by providing it to deserving dancers year after
					year.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first recipient of the Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship is Anoushka Rahman.
